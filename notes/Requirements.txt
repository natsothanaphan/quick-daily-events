I want to make a personal React app to add and display daily events.
For simplicity, there are 2 functionalities:
1. Add event, time from now up to 48 hrs ahead.
2. Display events from now - 12 hrs to now + 12 hrs.

What is an event?
- Timestamp: minute resolution, GMT (but displayed in local time)
- Name: string
- Details: string

We use Firebase
Auth = Firebase Auth
Backend = Functions + Firestore.

Subcollection by user id, event = {
    id: (firestore auto-generated)
    timestamp: timestamp
    name: string
    details: string
}

We should also probably index by timestamp.

API
POST /api/events
- Add event
- Auth token
- Body: {
    timestamp: timestamp
    name: string
    details: string
}

GET /api/events
- Get events
- Auth token

Frontend
React + Vite

Main Page = List of events, by timestamp descending.
Show only timestamp and name.
Click on event -> go to Details Page.
Has a form to add event.

Details Page = also show details.
Can go back to Main Page.
